# Problems when using bochs

```
Problem: cpu directive malformed?
Slove:   run `bochs --help cpu` to detect supported CPUs, then reinstall 
         new bochs that support the cpu(corei7_ivy_bridge_3770k) or 
         modified cpu items in bochs.conf 
```


```
Problem: bochs x11 window is black screen
Slove:   don't worry, because you just entered debug mode, and press 'c' to 
         continue
```
